# Parts list description from https://hackaday.com/2015/07/02/logic-noise-ping-pong-stereo-mixers-and-more/

ICs / Actives:
All of the 4000-series ICs are available under different names from different manufacturers.  Most of the chips in my drawer are from TI or Fairchild, but I’ve got a bunch from ON and NXP.  Most of the time, they’re interchangeable:
CD4xxx from TI and Fairchild Semiconductor
MC14xxx from ON Semiconductor
HEF4xxx from NXP

In buying ICs, I almost never buy one, and for most of these parts the volume discounts start at 10 pieces. Take the quantites below to be rough suggestions. You can never have too many useful parts.

10x 40106 hex inverter (you’ll use these everywhere)
10x 4069UB inverter, amplifier (UB is crucial)
4x 4051 eight-way switch
4x 4066 quad single-pole switch
2x 4040 binary counter
2x 4017 decimal counter
2x 4015 shift register (or 4094 if you won’t use the dual-clock functionality)
2x 4070 XOR
2x 2N3904/2N2222/BC548 or similar NPN signal transistors
(and soon:)
2x 4046 PLL
2x 4007 misc gates

Passives:
100x signal diodes, e.g. 1N4148.
100x 100k Ohm resistors (our mainstay)
100x 10k Ohm resistors (also useful)
A handful of odd-value resistors here and there. Get an assortment if you don’t already have one.
100x 0.1uF (100nF) capacitors. Ceramic/MLCC is fine.
100x 1uF capacitors. ditto
10x 10nF capacitors, ditto
10x 10uF capacitors, electrolytic, 16v is fine.
10x 100uF capacitors, electrolytic, ditto.

Potentiometers:
10x 100k Ohm linear potentiometers (this is where most of your budget will go, and honestly 20 wouldn’t be too many)
1x 100k stereo / dual potentiometer for bass drum circuit

Misc:
Some pushbuttons, but again you’ll never have too many
Breadboard and a lot of breadboarding wires
9V battery and clips to connect to breadboard, or power supply
Powered computer speakers or amp and speaker
3.5mm audio jack / stereo cable for output
